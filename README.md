# Foodies

At La Fosse Academy, we had the opportunity to work with Bootstrap for the first time, and it was definitely a challenge.

However, despite the time constraints and the learning curve of using a new tool, we were able to successfully create a website that allows users to easily select their desired recipe for each food item.
